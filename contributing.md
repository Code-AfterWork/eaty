# Contribution Guideline
You can work on any of the available issues or you can create an issue and work on it. This is a project designed for learners, so feel free to contribute in any small way that you are comfortable with. If you're stuck or need clarification, post your question in the Discussion section, or you can post the question on the discord server.

## Donation
We are going for a real-world example of a DevOps project. There are a few free services we'll use but in c=some cases we'll need to use premium/paid subscriptions in order to simulate a real-world use case. If you feel a little generouse and would like to contribute in purchasing any of the services, you can make a donation here or you can reach out to the Community Lead: mbadim@proton.me
